This App was created by Jason Kovalenko and Gabrielle Barling.
We performed a demo of the app for professor Bonamy in person.

The app is meant to capture images of raccoons that are stealing cat food and create wanted posters of them.
This app succesfully meets this criteria but it will also make a wanted poster of anything you take a picture of.

In order to test the app you must be able to build it onto a device because it uses the phone camera.
In addition you will require an API key to openAI which we will provide in the submission.
